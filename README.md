# jmeter_test_Athinodoros

Simply run the test file with jmeter
I added listeners in all the tests so the progress and the results 
can be seen separately...

The pdf contains the text to the 3 bullets we had to talk about(took  me 1,5 pages :/ )

if the tests fail initially it is because openshift is inactive.

I got confused and implemented the deductible exercise... But still the implementation is correct...

both api calls are POST requests 
BaseUrl : www.findmemo.com

paths
1) /interest
2) /discount

they accept json like this
1)
{
"deductableMet":${deductableMet}
}


2)
{
"deductableMet":${deductableMet},
"hospitalVisit":${hospitalVisit},
"doctorVisit":${doctorVisit}
}


I hope is enought :P 
It was a great exercise 
Learned a lot :)
